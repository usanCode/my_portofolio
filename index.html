    <p>
      Hello! My name is Usanase I am a woman . I describe myself as a self-taught coder because 
      all I have learned in the tech field I owe it to the internet. 
      I could not pursue my universities studies so I tried to find if it was possible to do that online. 
      I find an university that gave me a scolarship to study for an Associate degree. 
      From this, I discovered it was possible to become a developper thanks to courses 
      that can be found online. I started learning HTML and CSS by training myself. 
      I have also discovered JS,  Python and other programming languages. 
      I have been introduced to AI by learning Deep Learning. I have also heard about Blockchain . 
      I can say that I am more familiar with HTML and CSS. 
    </p>

   <div class="parts" id="Projectt-section"><h2>Project</h2>

   
    <p>
      New technologies are a real boon for social improvement, 
      not only on a personal level but also for a broad audience, 
      such as the neighborhood, the city, and the community in which 
      we live. I'm bubbling with ideas in this regard.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b><u>Project:</u></b> African proverbs and tales are little known. 
      I would like to create a website where people could read these stories.
      This project is still an idea.
